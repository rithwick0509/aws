The given paragraph discusses about the car owner ship being increased so rapidly over the past thirty years that many cities in the world are now 'one big traffic jam'.

Firstly, I think that vehicles in cities are increasing a lot. Because, for every house they are will be minimum of two cars. Every day most of the people travel in car for there works. All people have work at different places, but the reason for increase in traffic jam is, for example we can consider a family of 4 people, they all go to their works. They all will go to work at different places, considering a city, there are lots of people living in a city so those many vehicles will come out on that day, now a days all are having vehicles,  there are no one who don't have vehicle. So, the government should impose measures for people to reduce traffic jam. The only government can do decrease it, because of heavy traffic jam the medical emergencies or not fullfilled. Many people have health issues, the main one is when they are in need of ambulance vehicles. With this heavy traffic jam the ambulance vehiclescare not going on time. 

Yes it is true that, that government should keep a rule. Every day only one vehicle should come out of home. I suggest to travelning on a bycycle instead of a car because it ocuupys less sapce. These type of rules should be taken by the government.
