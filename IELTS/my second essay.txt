The given paragraph discusses about the people who work for the same organisation all their working life and the people who think that it is better to work for different organisation.

Firstly, I would like to speak about the people who work for the same organisation. Many people work for the same organisation for many years because they will reach senior employee position and they get a high pay. He will enjoy working in the same company because he knows about his work. He will become familiar with the company and people who work there. He knows the loop holes of his company. But coming to the drawbacks of working in same company is that, people won't get growth and they only work in that company, they don't know about other company's development. 

Secondly, I would like to speak about the people who work for different organisations. People who want a change in their work style tend to keep changing. They get to know the different types of positions and gain more knowledge. They meet different kinds of people and get an opportunity to mingle with them. Even after working in different companies they will get more salary as they are exposed to different work fields.

My opinion on this is, I  feel working in different organisations is better. I personally choose to work in this way because I want to explore my work for other positions, I want to meet new people and a change in my work style.
