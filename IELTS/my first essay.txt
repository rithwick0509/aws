My essay topic is "Trip to Vizag". I went for a wedding at Vizag in January 2021 with my friends. We started from Hyderabad at 4 in the morning with a group of 7 people. We had various stops on our way. We travelled approximately 650kms. On the same day we reached Vizag at 8 in the evening. 
Immediately after reaching, we rested at a hotel, and then we went out to see the night life of Vizag. It was so beautiful in the night. The next day, the wedding preparations were going on. In the evening we attended the bachelor's party. We enjoyed a lot and we had drinks. The following day we attended the marriage. Later we went to Simhachalam temple, it was build with beautiful infrastructure, we took lots of pictures. On the following day we stayed at Lambasingi for a day in a camp, we put campfire and had a great time talking with my friends. The next day morning we went for trekking, we reached the hill top. It is famous for "Little of Kashmir", for it's beautiful view.
The very next day we started back home. This will be my best trip till date.
